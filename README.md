------------------------------

This website is for my discord bot, Ethery Bot.

I used HTML5 to create it and It took nearly 12 hours to make, please do not copy anything on the website unless you give credit to me [Ethery](https://github.com/EtheryBot).


Why is it Blue : I made the theme discord colours because I like the colour blurple.

Tips for making a website : Learn how to code HTML5 and you will need brackets Live Server on [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com), you can get the brackets plugin [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.brackets-pack).

How do you make your bots : I make my bots on Discord.js and Visual Studio Code. 

What did you use to make it : I used Brackets Live Server to view what my website looks like live when im coding like CSS, I also recommend going with a colour combo when making website and not going for bad or dark colours. Use light colours because it will make your website look good.
